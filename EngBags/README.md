# EngBags
EngBags, with some of the changes made by Baroque to EngInventory ported forward, a bagbar on the inventory screen, and improved usability for having insanely large bags for both inventory and bank.

# Known Issues
- If you take a bag out of a slot and don't replace it, the original bag icon sometimes stays there. This fixes itself on reload, relog, or just placing a new bag there. Not a serious issue so I'm not gonna bother trying to fix it.
- The bag icons don't shift in size.  I've added extra padding to prevent them from overlapping items.
- If you don't have at least 12 collumns (more if you have a lot of gold), the bag bar will run into your money tracker. So, go thicc or go home.
